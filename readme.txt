You always wanted more options in your country's government, if yes, this mod is for you.

This mod is a agroupment and adjustment of two of my favorite mods, so go there to check them (Because i don't deserve any credit): 
Extended Government Laws - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835918659
Hearts of Iron: New World Order - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726036596

I had done some balances, and added a civilian police for more options in the Government.
